# Handwritten Digit Recognition with GUI

This repository demonstrates a simple Handwritten Digit Recognition system using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **Tkinter**. The project includes a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for recognizing digits drawn by the user on a canvas. The digits are classified using a trained **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model.

---

## Features
- Draw digits directly on a GUI canvas and recognize them in real-time.
- Train the KNN model using custom datasets.
- Provides clear error handling for missing files or incorrect inputs.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries (see [Installation](#installation) for setup)
- A compatible OS (Windows/Linux/Mac)

---

## Dataset
The dataset for training handwritten digits can be downloaded from [Kaggle: Handwritten Digits 0-9](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olafkrastovski/handwritten-digits-0-9).

### Note:
Ensure that the dataset is organized in the following structure:
```
dataset/
│
├── 0/
│   ├── img1.jpg
│   ├── img2.jpg
│   └── ...
├── 1/
│   ├── img1.jpg
│   ├── img2.jpg
│   └── ...
├── ...
└── 9/
```

The images must be in **grayscale** and sized **90x140 pixels**. The script skips invalid or incorrectly sized images.

---

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download and prepare the dataset:
   - Download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olafkrastovski/handwritten-digits-0-9).
   - Place the dataset in the `dataset` folder as shown in the [Dataset](#dataset) section.

4. Ensure you have the following necessary files:
   - `classification.txt` and `flatcharimages.txt`: These files will be generated when you run the `main.py` script. If these files are missing, run `main.py` first to prepare the training data.

---

## Usage
1. **Prepare Training Data**:
   - Run `main.py` to process the dataset and generate the necessary training files:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - This will create two files:
     - `classification.txt`: Contains digit labels.
     - `flatcharimages.txt`: Contains flattened image data.

2. **Run the GUI Application**:
   - Launch the GUI for digit recognition:
     ```bash
     python GUIrecog.py
     ```
   - Use the canvas to draw digits and click "Recognize Digits" to classify them.

## Folder Structure
```
<repository-name>/
│
├── dataset/                 # Folder containing digit images (0-9) for training
├── main.py                  # Script for preparing the training data
├── GUIrecog.py              # GUI for digit recognition
├── classification.txt       # Training data labels (generated by main.py)
├── flatcharimages.txt       # Flattened image data (generated by main.py)
├── requirements.txt         # Required Python libraries
└── README.md                # Documentation
```

---

## Dataset Directory Structure

The dataset folder should be structured as follows:

```
dataset/
│
├── 0/
│   ├── img1.jpg
│   ├── img2.jpg
│   └── ...   # Images of digit '0'
├── 1/
│   ├── img1.jpg
│   ├── img2.jpg
│   └── ...   # Images of digit '1'
├── 2/
│   ├── img1.jpg
│   ├── img2.jpg
│   └── ...   # Images of digit '2'
├── 3/
│   ├── img1.jpg
│   ├── img2.jpg
│   └── ...   # Images of digit '3'
├── ...
│   └── ...   # Continue for digits 4 through 9
├── 9/
│   ├── img1.jpg
│   ├── img2.jpg
│   └── ...   # Images of digit '9'
```

### Notes:
- Each subfolder (`0` to `9`) contains grayscale images corresponding to the respective digit.
- **File Format**: The images must be in `.jpg` format.
- **Image Dimensions**: Ensure that all images are resized to **90x140 pixels** to match the model's requirements.

If the folder structure or image format is incorrect, the scripts may not function as expected.

---

## Known Issues
1. **Missing Files**:
   - If `classification.txt` or `flatcharimages.txt` is missing, ensure you run `main.py` before using the GUI.
   - If the `flattenedimagechar.txt` file is required but missing, ensure that the `main.py` script is updated to output this file or use existing files.

2. **Image Size Mismatch**:
   - The dataset images must be **90x140 pixels**. Images with incorrect dimensions will be skipped during processing.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for loading pre-trained models.
- Improve the GUI design for better usability.
- Add support for training custom datasets directly from the GUI.
- Introduce machine learning models like CNN for improved recognition accuracy.
